Mozilla Beamer Class
====================


About
-----

This repository contains a tentative beamer class to achieve some Mozilla slides, inspired from:
* http://fr.slideshare.net/nitot/dws12-14-novtristannitotsmartdevice
* http://fr.slideshare.net/fabi1cazenave/firefox-os-15241734


Usage
-----

See example-talk.tex for how to use (it should be as simple as using the class). PDFs are available as demo.


Notes
-----

As you can see, you can use beamer notes. To take advantage of those, one can use QPdfPresenterConsole:
* project at https://sourceforge.net/p/qpdfpresenter/
* ubuntu ppa at https://launchpad.net/~lissyx/+archive/qpdfpresenterconsole-ppa
* sources (with debian packaging) at http://gitorious.org/qpdfpresenterconsole
